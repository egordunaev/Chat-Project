# Chat_Project

Chat Project simulates a server-client type of chat in console window with some added 'Bots' who could tell you time, current weather (unfortunatly, locked only for Ivanovo and just opens new tab in your web-browser), you could google something (only opens a new page on google with your request) and send SMS-messages (API keys and login information were removed for safety, but on paper it works!) 

This project was intended only for learning purposes, do not use this.
